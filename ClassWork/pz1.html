  <h1>Vehicle</h1>
  <h2></h2>

  <p>A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<sup><b><a href="#p123">[1]</a></b></sup>) is a machine that transports people or
    cargo. Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles
    (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft
    (airplanes, helicopters) and spacecraft.m<sup><b><a href="#p223">[2]</a></b></sup>

  <p>Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground:
    wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for road
    vehicles types, terms and definitions.m<sup><b><a href="#p455">[3]</a></b></sup>
