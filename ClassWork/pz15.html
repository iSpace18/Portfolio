        <h1>William Shakespeare</h1>
        <hr>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">From Wikipedia yhe free encyclopedia</p>
        <p>William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright and actor, widely
          regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called
          England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of
          approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain
          authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than
          those of any other playwright.</p>
        <p>Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne
          Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and
          1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called
          the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired
          to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has
          stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his
          religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. Such theories are often
          criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period.</p>
        <p>Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies
          and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. Until about 1608, he wrote
          mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest
          works in the English language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances)
          and collaborated with other playwrights. </p>
        <p>Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime.
          However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell, published a
          more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works
          that included all but two of his plays. The volume was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson
          presciently hails Shakespeare in a now-famous quote as "not of an age, but for all time".</p>
        <p>Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare's works have been continually adapted and rediscovered by
          new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain popular and are studied, performed, and
          reinterpreted through various cultural and political contexts around the world.</p>
