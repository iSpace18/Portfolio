            <b>Computer programming</b> is the process of designing and building
            an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific
            computing task. <b>Programming</b> involves tasks such as: analysis,
            generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource
            consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen
            programming language (commonly referred to as coding). The source
            code of a program is written in one or more languages. The purpose
            of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will
            automate the performance of a task on a computer, often for solving
            a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires
            expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the
            application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <hr />
      <div class="history_text">
        <p>
          Programmable devices have existed at least as far back as 1206 AD,
          when the automata of Al-Jazari were programmable, via pegs and cams,
          to play various rhythms and drum patterns; and the 1801 Jacquard loom
          could produce entirely different weaves by changing the "program" - a
          series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when
          mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a
          sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles
          Babbage's Analytical Engine. Women would continue to dominate the
          field of computer programming until the mid 1960s.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in
          machine-readable form. Later a control panel (plugboard) added to his
          1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs,
          and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and
          IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in a similar way; as were
          the first electronic computers. However, with the concept of the
          stored-program computers introduced in 1949, both programs and data
          were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the
          instruction set of the particular machine, often in binary notation.
          Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer specify
          instruction in a text format, (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations
          for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying addresses.
          However, because an assembly language is little more than a different
          notation for a machine language, any two machines with different
          instruction sets also have different assembly languages. Kathleen
          Booth created one of the first Assembly languages in 1950 for various
          computers at Birkbeck College.

      <h3>Modern programming</h3>
      <hr />
      <h4>Quality requirements</h4>
      <p>
        Whatever the approach to development may be, the final program must
        satisfy some fundamental properties. The following properties are among
        the most important:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Reliability: how often the results of a program are correct. This
          depends on conceptual correctness of algorithms, and minimization of
          programming mistakes, such as mistakes in resource management (e.g.,
          buffer overflows and race conditions) and logic errors (such as
          division by zero or off-by-one errors).
        </li>
        <li>
          Robustness: how well a program anticipates problems due to errors (not
          bugs). This includes situations such as incorrect, inappropriate or
          corrupt data, unavailability of needed resources such as memory,
          operating system services and network connections, user error, and
          unexpected power outages.
        </li>
        <li>
          Usability: the ergonomics of a program: the ease with which a person
          can use the program for its intended purpose or in some cases even
          unanticipated purposes. Such issues can make or break its success even
          regardless of other issues. This involves a wide range of textual,
          graphical and sometimes hardware elements that improve the clarity,
          intuitiveness, cohesiveness and completeness of a program's user
          interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          Portability: the range of computer hardware and operating system
          platforms on which the source code of a program can be
          compiled/interpreted and run. This depends on differences in the
          programming facilities provided by the different platforms, including
          hardware and operating system resources, expected behavior of the
          hardware and operating system, and availability of platform specific
          compilers (and sometimes libraries) for the language of the source
          code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Maintainability: the ease with which a program can be modified by its
          present or future developers in order to make improvements or
          customizations, fix bugs and security holes, or adapt it to new
          environments. Good practices[24] during initial development make the
          difference in this regard. This quality may not be directly apparent
          to the end user but it can significantly affect the fate of a program
          over the long term.
        </li>
        <li>
          Efficiency/performance: Measure of system resources a program consumes
          (processor time, memory space, slow devices such as disks, network
          bandwidth and to some extent even user interaction): the less, the
          better. This also includes careful management of resources, for
          example cleaning up temporary files and eliminating memory leaks.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Readability of source code</h4>
      <p>
        In computer programming, readability refers to the ease with which a
        human reader can comprehend the purpose, control flow, and operation of
        source code. It affects the aspects of quality above, including
        portability, usability and most importantly maintainability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Readability is important because programmers spend the majority of their
        time reading, trying to understand and modifying existing source code,
        rather than writing new source code. Unreadable code often leads to
        bugs, inefficiencies, and duplicated code. A study[25] found that a few
        simple readability transformations made code shorter and drastically
        reduced the time to understand it.
      </p>
      <h4>Algorithmic complexity</h4>
      <p>
        The academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming
        are both largely concerned with discovering and implementing the most
        efficient algorithms for a given class of problem. For this purpose,
        algorithms are classified into orders using so-called Big O notation,
        which expresses resource use, such as execution time or memory
        consumption, in terms of the size of an input. Expert programmers are
        familiar with a variety of well-established algorithms and their
        respective complexities and use this knowledge to choose algorithms that
        are best suited to the circumstances.
      </p>
      <h4>Chess algorithms as an example</h4>
      <p>
        "Programming a Computer for Playing Chess" was a 1950 paper that
        evaluated a "minimax" algorithm that is part of the history of
        algorithmic complexity; a course on IBM's Deep Blue (chess computer) is
        part of the computer science curriculum at Stanford University.[27]

      <h3>Programming languages</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Different programming languages support different styles of programming
        (called programming paradigms). The choice of language used is subject
        to many considerations, such as company policy, suitability to task,
        availability of third-party packages, or individual preference. Ideally,
        the programming language best suited for the task at hand will be
        selected. Trade-offs from this ideal involve finding enough programmers
        who know the language to build a team, the availability of compilers for
        that language, and the efficiency with which programs written in a given
        language execute. Languages form an approximate spectrum from
        "low-level" to "high-level"; "low-level" languages are typically more
        machine-oriented and faster to execute, whereas "high-level" languages
        are more abstract and easier to use but execute less quickly. It is
        usually easier to code in "high-level" languages than in "low-level"
        ones.
      </p>
