                        The cat (Felis cats) is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the
                        family Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of
                        the family. The cat is either a house cat, kept as a pet, or a feral cat, freely ranging and
                        avoiding human contact. [5] A house cat is valued by humans for companionship and for its
                        ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.

                    Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felid species, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes,
                    sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. They are predators who are most
                    active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular). Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for
                    human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals.
                    Compared to humans, they see better in the dark (they see in near total darkness) and have a better
                    sense of smell, but poorer color vision. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species.
                    Cat communication includes the use of vocalizations including mewing, purring, trilling, hissing,
                    growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language.[7] Cats also communicate by secreting
                    and perceiving pheromones.
                    Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes ranging from two
                    to five kittens. Domestic cats can be bred and shown as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as
                    cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as
                    abandonment of pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the
                    extinction of entire bird species, and evoking population control.
